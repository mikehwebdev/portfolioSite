        review: "Possibly John Carpenter's finest film and definitely the best body horror film ever  - The Thing should be on the the top ten list of any horror fan. With a magnificent soundtrack written by Ennio Morricone (of The Good, The Bad and The Ugly fame) and terrifyingly gruesome effects work by Rob Bottin The Thing should always be the first on the list for any horror themed movie night.",

        review: "For me It Follows is probably the best horror film of the 2010s.  With a totally unique premise monster, breathtaking camera work and for me the best jump scare ever, It Follows is an underappreciated gem. If you haven't seen it stop reading and do so now. ",

        review: "Given the impossible task of rebooting a beloved horror franchise, Fede Álvarez absolutely smashed it for his feature film debut. Breathing fresh life into the fabulously grotesque corpse of the Evil Dead series, Fede made it his own and did the almost impossible. The final act feels a little weak but only because the first two are horrifying beyond words (in a good way). If you love 80's horror and the most realistic make up and effects work I've ever seen, give it a watch. ",

        review: "The Fly. Peerless horror from the endlessly talented David Cronenberg. My favourite horror film of my teenage years, with excellent performances of Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davies, I'm amazed by how small the cast  is for a film that feels so much larger. With a technical but relatively simple story, The Fly gets into the action and doesn't let you go until Seth Brundle's terrifying and sad conclusion. ",

        review: "I hadn't heard anything about Midsommar before watching it and, oh my, am I glad. A suite of superb performances by it's young cast, a wonderfully unpredictable story (so rare for Hollywood) and a genuinely sad and uncomfortable watch this is probably the most layered and complex film on this list. Too much so? Maybe. It does suffer a little from “I need to Google this because there are bits I missed” but it does have a fascinating rabbit hole like quality to its internet community that can take you to some wonderfully terrifying places.",

        review: "Oh. My. God. Beautifully directed. Incredibly written. Some of the finest acting of all time, and certainly the best and most heart wrenching monologue I've ever seen delivered by Toni Collete, Hereditary is not only one of the finest horror films ever but one of the best family dramas. Ari Aster managing to weave the two genres together is nothing short of miraculous. It's s shame the horror element would put some off as this is on of the finest films ever made. Everyone should watch it.",

        subHeader:"In space no one can hear you scream.",
        review: "What can I say? Alien - the daddy of sci-fi horror. Ridley Scott created one of the best films ever, inspiring generations of film makers, comic writers, video game developers, screen writers and make up artists. The industry wouldn't be the same without his film, Sigourney Weaver's performance, and HR Gigers peerless design. It's DNA permeates the entire industry and has huge and continuing influence even half a century later. I'd been a horror and film fan my whole life, but at 13 years old, sitting up at 1am watching Alien with my best friend on his tiny little CRT, drinking ciders pinched from the kitchen and my LOVE for film was born. The best film ever. ",
